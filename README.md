# Character-Recognition
Built a Logistic Regression algorithm from scratch, to recognise a character given an image.
There are 2 files with 28 *28 grayscale images. Each image is encoded as a row of 784 integer values between 0 and 255 indicating the brightness of each pixel. 
The label associated with each image is encoded as an integer value between 0 and 9. The dataset is an MNIST dataset.

Results-
The model has an accuracy of 0.9175. The maximum number of misclassifications is for the digit 5, while, the minimum number of misclassifications is for the digit 0.
